# Behavior

Behavior can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences, and help move them forward — from here to there, now to next, start to finish — and make progress.

## Properties

Some properties are better to animate than others since *some properties trigger more work for
the browser than others*. With a few exceptions, **animations** should be created by making changes
to **the transform and opacity properties**.
